Good  question Im going to let  you answer that yourselves with a view to  digital advertising 
Message  boards and many other  thoughts that I have had for quite some time

Solid now and working on some other interesting ideas to use this for with relevance to communications seeing as we are 
now faced with lock-down nothing but covid  , covid and more covid   
The usual nothing but bad news  but whats new
